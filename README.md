# Memento MCP: A Knowledge Graph Memory System for LLMs

![Memento MCP Logo](assets/memento-logo-gray.svg)

Scalable, high performance knowledge graph memory system with semantic search, temporal awareness, and advanced relation management. Provides any LLM client that supports the model context protocol (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor, Github Copilot) with persistent ontological memory.

[![Memento MCP Tests](https://github.com/gannonh/memento-mcp/actions/workflows/memento-mcp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gannonh/memento-mcp/actions/workflows/memento-mcp.yml)

## Core Concepts

### Entities

Entities are the primary nodes in the knowledge graph. Each entity has:

* A unique name (identifier)
* An entity type (e.g., "person", "organization", "event")
* A list of observations
* Vector embeddings (for semantic search)
* Complete version history

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "John_Smith",
  "entityType": "person",
  "observations": ["Speaks fluent Spanish"]
}
```

### Relations

Relations define directed connections between entities with enhanced properties:

* Strength indicators (0.0-1.0)
* Confidence levels (0.0-1.0)
* Rich metadata (source, timestamps, tags)
* Temporal awareness with version history
* Time-based confidence decay

Example:

```json
{
  "from": "John_Smith",
  "to": "Anthropic",
  "relationType": "works_at",
  "strength": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "metadata": {
    "source": "linkedin_profile",
    "last_verified": "2025-03-21"
  }
}
```

## Storage Backend

Memento MCP uses Neo4j as its storage backend, providing a unified solution for both graph storage and vector search capabilities.

### Why Neo4j?

* **Unified Storage**: Consolidates both graph and vector storage into a single database
* **Native Graph Operations**: Built specifically for graph traversal and queries
* **Integrated Vector Search**: Vector similarity search for embeddings built directly into Neo4j
* **Scalability**: Better performance with large knowledge graphs
* **Simplified Architecture**: Clean design with a single database for all operations

### Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose for running Neo4j
* Neo4j 5.13+ (required for vector search capabilities)

### Neo4j Setup with Docker

The project includes a Docker Compose configuration for Neo4j:

```bash
# Start Neo4j container
docker-compose up -d neo4j

# Stop Neo4j container
docker-compose stop neo4j

# Remove Neo4j container (preserves data)
docker-compose rm neo4j
```

The Neo4j database will be available at:

* **Bolt URI**: `bolt://localhost:7687` (for driver connections)
* **HTTP**: `http://localhost:7474` (for Neo4j Browser UI)
* **Default credentials**: username: `neo4j`, password: `memento_password`

### Neo4j CLI Utilities

Memento MCP includes command-line utilities for managing Neo4j operations:

#### Testing Connection

Test the connection to your Neo4j database:

```bash
# Test with default settings
npm run neo4j:test

# Test with custom settings
npm run neo4j:test -- --uri bolt://custom-host:7687 --username myuser --password mypass --database neo4j
```

#### Initializing Schema

Initialize the Neo4j schema with required constraints and indexes:

```bash
# Initialize with default settings
npm run neo4j:init

# Initialize with custom vector dimensions
npm run neo4j:init -- --dimensions 768 --similarity euclidean

# Force recreation of all constraints and indexes
npm run neo4j:init -- --recreate

# Combine multiple options
npm run neo4j:init -- --vector-index custom_index --dimensions 384 --recreate
```

### Data Persistence and Management

Neo4j data persists across container restarts and even version upgrades due to the Docker volume configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./neo4j-data:/data
  - ./neo4j-logs:/logs
  - ./neo4j-import:/import
```

These mappings ensure that:

* `/data` directory (contains all database files) persists on your host at `./neo4j-data`
* `/logs` directory persists on your host at `./neo4j-logs`
* `/import` directory (for importing data files) persists at `./neo4j-import`

You can modify these paths in your `docker-compose.yml` file to store data in different locations if needed.

#### Upgrading Neo4j Version

You can change Neo4j editions and versions without losing data:

1. Update the Neo4j image version in `docker-compose.yml`
2. Restart the container with `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d neo4j`
3. Reinitialize the schema with `npm run neo4j:init`

The data will persist through this process as long as the volume mappings remain the same.

#### Complete Database Reset

If you need to completely reset your Neo4j database:

```bash
# Stop the container
docker-compose stop neo4j

# Remove the container
docker-compose rm -f neo4j

# Delete the data directory contents
rm -rf ./neo4j-data/*

# Restart the container
docker-compose up -d neo4j

# Reinitialize the schema
npm run neo4j:init
```

#### Backing Up Data

To back up your Neo4j data, you can simply copy the data directory:

```bash
# Make a backup of the Neo4j data
cp -r ./neo4j-data ./neo4j-data-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

## Advanced Features

### Semantic Search

Find semantically related entities based on meaning rather than just keywords:

* **Vector Embeddings**: Entities are automatically encoded into high-dimensional vector space using OpenAI's embedding models
* **Cosine Similarity**: Find related concepts even when they use different terminology
* **Configurable Thresholds**: Set minimum similarity scores to control result relevance
* **Cross-Modal Search**: Query with text to find relevant entities regardless of how they were described
* **Multi-Model Support**: Compatible with multiple embedding models (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small/large)
* **Contextual Retrieval**: Retrieve information based on semantic meaning rather than exact keyword matches
* **Optimized Defaults**: Tuned parameters for balance between precision and recall (0.6 similarity threshold, hybrid search enabled)
* **Hybrid Search**: Combines semantic and keyword search for more comprehensive results

### Temporal Awareness

Track complete history of entities and relations with point-in-time graph retrieval:

* **Full Version History**: Every change to an entity or relation is preserved with timestamps
* **Point-in-Time Queries**: Retrieve the exact state of the knowledge graph at any moment in the past
* **Change Tracking**: Automatically records createdAt, updatedAt, validFrom, and validTo timestamps
* **Temporal Consistency**: Maintain a historically accurate view of how knowledge evolved
* **Non-Destructive Updates**: Updates create new versions rather than overwriting existing data
* **Time-Based Filtering**: Filter graph elements based on temporal criteria
* **History Exploration**: Investigate how specific information changed over time

### Confidence Decay

Relations automatically decay in confidence over time based on configurable half-life:

* **Time-Based Decay**: Confidence in relations naturally decreases over time if not reinforced
* **Configurable Half-Life**: Define how quickly information becomes less certain (default: 30 days)
* **Minimum Confidence Floors**: Set thresholds to prevent over-decay of important information
* **Decay Metadata**: Each relation includes detailed decay calculation information
* **Non-Destructive**: Original confidence values are preserved alongside decayed values
* **Reinforcement Learning**: Relations regain confidence when reinforced by new observations
* **Reference Time Flexibility**: Calculate decay based on arbitrary reference times for historical analysis

### Advanced Metadata

Rich metadata support for both entities and relations with custom fields:

* **Source Tracking**: Record where information originated (user input, analysis, external sources)
* **Confidence Levels**: Assign confidence scores (0.0-1.0) to relations based on certainty
* **Relation Strength**: Indicate importance or strength of relationships (0.0-1.0)
* **Temporal Metadata**: Track when information was added, modified, or verified
* **Custom Tags**: Add arbitrary tags for classification and filtering
* **Structured Data**: Store complex structured data within metadata fields
* **Query Support**: Search and filter based on metadata properties
* **Extensible Schema**: Add custom fields as needed without modifying the core data model

* `text-embedding-3-large`: Higher accuracy, more expensive (3072 dimensions)
* `text-embedding-ada-002`: Legacy model (1536 dimensions)

#### OpenAI API Configuration

To use semantic search, you'll need to configure OpenAI API credentials:

1. Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Configure your environment with:

```bash
# OpenAI API Key for embeddings
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
# Default embedding model
OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
```

> **Note**: For testing environments, the system will mock embedding generation if no API key is provided. However, using real embeddings is recommended for integration testing.

## Integration with Claude Desktop

### Configuration

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memento": {
      "command": "/path/to/node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/memory-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_STORAGE_TYPE": "neo4j",
        "NEO4J_URI": "bolt://localhost:7687",
        "NEO4J_USERNAME": "neo4j",
        "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "memento_password",
        "NEO4J_DATABASE": "neo4j",
        "NEO4J_VECTOR_INDEX": "entity_embeddings",
        "NEO4J_VECTOR_DIMENSIONS": "1536",
        "NEO4J_SIMILARITY_FUNCTION": "cosine",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-openai-api-key",
        "OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL": "text-embedding-3-small",
        "DEBUG": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Important**: Always explicitly specify the embedding model in your Claude Desktop configuration to ensure consistent behavior.

### Recommended System Prompts

For optimal integration with Claude, add these statements to your system prompt:

```
You have access to the Memento MCP knowledge graph memory system, which provides you with persistent memory capabilities.
Your memory tools are provided by Memento MCP, a sophisticated knowledge graph implementation.
When asked about past conversations or user information, always check the Memento MCP knowledge graph first.
You should use semantic_search to find relevant information in your memory when answering questions.
```

### Testing Semantic Search

Once configured, Claude can access the semantic search capabilities through natural language:

1. To create entities with semantic embeddings:

   ```
   User: "Remember that Python is a high-level programming language known for its readability and JavaScript is primarily used for web development."
   ```

2. To search semantically:

   ```
   User: "What programming languages do you know about that are good for web development?"
   ```

3. To retrieve specific information:

   ```
   User: "Tell me everything you know about Python."
   ```

The power of this approach is that users can interact naturally, while the LLM handles the complexity of selecting and using the appropriate memory tools.

## Troubleshooting

### Vector Search Diagnostics

Memento MCP includes built-in diagnostic capabilities to help troubleshoot vector search issues:

* **Embedding Verification**: The system checks if entities have valid embeddings and automatically generates them if missing
* **Vector Index Status**: Verifies that the vector index exists and is in the ONLINE state
* **Fallback Search**: If vector search fails, the system falls back to text-based search
* **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging of vector search operations for troubleshooting

### Debug Tools (when DEBUG=true)

Additional diagnostic tools become available when debug mode is enabled:

* **diagnose_vector_search**: Information about the Neo4j vector index, embedding counts, and search functionality
* **force_generate_embedding**: Forces the generation of an embedding for a specific entity
* **debug_embedding_config**: Information about the current embedding service configuration
